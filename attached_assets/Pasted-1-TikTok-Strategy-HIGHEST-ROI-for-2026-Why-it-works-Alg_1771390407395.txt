1. TikTok Strategy (HIGHEST ROI for 2026)
Why it works: Algorithmic reach means zero followers can go viral. Perfect for demonstrating digital products visually.
Step-by-Step TikTok Blueprint:
SETUP (Week 1):

Create a business account with a clear niche name: "@NotionForCreatives" not "@JohnSmith123"
Bio formula: "What you do + Who it's for + CTA" → "Notion templates for busy entrepreneurs 📊 | Free starter template ⬇️"
Link in bio: Use Beacons, Linktree, or Stan Store to house your free lead magnet + paid products
Profile aesthetic: Use your template designs or brand colors as profile picture

CONTENT STRATEGY (Daily posting):
Week 1-2: Value-First Content (No selling)

Post 2-3 times daily showing transformations, tutorials, or tips
Example for Canva templates: "3 mistakes making your Instagram posts look unprofessional"
Example for Notion: "How I organize my entire life in one dashboard (tour)"
Hook in first 1 second, deliver value in 15-30 seconds

Week 3-4: Soft Introduction

Continue value content but mention "I created a template for this"
Show yourself USING your product in real scenarios
Don't link to products yet—just plant seeds

Week 5+: Strategic Product Integration

70% value content, 30% product-related content
Product content formats that work:

Before/After transformations (show chaos → organized with your template)
Tutorial + Template ("Here's how to do X, I have a template that does this automatically")
Speed run videos ("Watch me design 10 Instagram posts in 5 minutes using my template")
Behind-the-scenes creation ("Making a new Notion template based on your requests")



VIRAL HOOKS THAT WORK:

"I made $X selling this simple template..."
"Stop wasting time doing X manually..."
"If you're still using [inferior method], watch this..."
"This [tool] changed how I [outcome]..."
"POV: You finally organize your [thing]..."

HASHTAG STRATEGY:

3-5 hashtags maximum (TikTok prioritizes watch time over hashtags now)
Mix: 1 broad (#productivity), 1 medium (#notiontemplate), 1 niche (#notionforwriters)
Create a branded hashtag for user-generated content (#MyNotionLife)

ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:

Reply to every comment in first hour (boosts algorithm)
Use comment replies as new video ideas
Create "stitch" or "duet" responses to popular videos in your niche
Go live once a week to build deeper connection

MONETIZATION PATH:

Pin comment with "Free template version in bio 📌"
Free template captures email
Email sequence sells premium version
Or: Direct link to Gumroad/Stan Store in bio


2. Pinterest Strategy (PASSIVE TRAFFIC MACHINE)
Why it works: Long-term evergreen traffic. People actively search for templates and tools. Pins can drive traffic for years.
Step-by-Step Pinterest Blueprint:
SETUP:

Convert to business account (free analytics + rich pins)
Claim your website (Gumroad, Etsy, personal site)
Create 5-10 boards around your niche:

"Canva Templates for Instagram"
"Social Media Design Inspiration"
"Canva Tutorials"
"Brand Identity Templates"


Enable rich pins for product details

PROFILE OPTIMIZATION:

Use keyword-rich description: "Free & Premium Canva Templates | Instagram, Pinterest & TikTok Designs | For Content Creators & Small Businesses"
Professional profile photo matching your brand
Verify website to get that checkmark

PIN CREATION STRATEGY:
Image Requirements:

Vertical format: 1000 x 1500 pixels (2:3 ratio)
Bright, eye-catching colors
Text overlay readable on mobile
Show your product in action

PIN FORMULA (Create 10 pins per product):
Pin #1: Product showcase

Title: "Instagram Canva Templates Bundle - 100 Editable Posts"
Description: "Save hours with these professionally designed Instagram templates for Canva. Perfect for coaches, bloggers, and small businesses. Editable colors, fonts, and layouts. Instant download. #CanvaTemplates #InstagramTemplates #SocialMediaTemplates"
Show template grid/collection

Pin #2: Before/After transformation

Every pin links to a landing page (not directly to checkout)
Landing page: Show more images + benefits + social proof + buy button
Offer lead magnet: "Download 3 free templates" → capture email → sell bundle

Create value boards: Save others' pins related to your niche (builds authority)

Who you help
Social proof
CTA

"10 Notion databases every creator needs:"
Thread format: Hook + 8-10 points + CTA at end
Each point = 1 tweet with image/GIF if possible
Final tweet: "I built all of these into one template [link]"

Tweet Type 2: Quick Tips (Daily)

"Notion tip: Use the /remind command to create reminders without leaving your page"
Bite-sized, actionable, retweetable
No product mention - pure value

Tweet Type 3: Product Mentions (1-2x/week)

- Use emojis for scannability  
- One clear idea per tweet
- Include images/examples

ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:

Spend 30 mins daily engaging BEFORE you tweet
Reply to bigger accounts in your niche (thoughtfully, not spam)
Join Twitter Spaces in your niche
Create or join engagement groups (5-10 people who engage with each other)
Use Twitter Lists to organize accounts to engage with

MONETIZATION APPROACH:

Tweet link = Use stan.store or beacons for multiple products
Lead magnet tweet: Free template → email capture → paid product sequence
Limited drops: "20% off for next 24 hours" creates urgency
Twitter Spaces: Host Q&A, mention products naturally

HASHTAG USE:

Less important on Twitter than other platforms
Use 1-2 max: #notion #productivity
Focus more on @mentions and engagement


6. LinkedIn Strategy (B2B DIGITAL PRODUCTS)
Why it works: Professional audience willing to pay premium. Great for productivity tools, business templates, software.
Step-by-Step LinkedIn Blueprint:
PROFILE SETUP:

Professional headshot
Headline: "Helping [audience] achieve [result] | Creator of [product]"
Example: "Helping project managers save 10 hours/week | Creator of the PM Dashboard for Notion"
About section: Tell your story + what you offer + CTA
Featured section: Pin your products, testimonials, case studies
Creator mode ON (allows you to be followed, not just connected)

CONTENT STRATEGY (Post 3-5x/week):
Format 1: Story-Based Posts (Highest engagement)
3 months ago, I was drowning in spreadsheets.

My project tracking was chaos.
My team was confused.
I was working 60-hour weeks.

So I built a simple Notion template.

Today:
→ 30% more efficient
→ Team loves the clarity  
→ Working 40-hour weeks

Here's what I learned about [topic]...

[Continue story with insights]

P.S. - If you want the template, comment "TEMPLATE" and I'll send it
Format 2: Carousel Posts (Great for templates)

Export your template screenshots as PDF
Use Canva to create carousel slides
Title slide + 8-10 value slides + CTA slide
"Swipe to see my exact Notion setup for client management →"

Format 3: Video Posts (Underused = high reach)

1-2 minute screen recordings
Walk through your template
Native video (don't link to YouTube)
Captions required (most watch without sound)

Format 4: Poll Posts

"What's your biggest challenge with project management?"
Options trigger discussions
Comment with your product as solution
Great for market research

ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:

Comment on 10-15 posts daily in your niche BEFORE you post
Thoughtful comments (2-3 sentences minimum)
Connect with everyone who engages with your posts
Send connection request with note: "Hey [name], loved your comment on [topic]. Would love to connect!"

MONETIZATION:

CTA in posts: "Comment TEMPLATE below"
DM them the link (builds relationship)
Or: Link in first comment
Featured section = permanent product showcase
LinkedIn Articles: Long-form content with embedded product links


7. Reddit Strategy (NICHE COMMUNITIES)
Why it works: Highly targeted audiences. People actively seeking solutions. Low competition if done right.
Step-by-Step Reddit Blueprint:
ACCOUNT SETUP:

Don't use business name initially (feels spammy)
Build karma first (comment helpful replies in your niche subreddits for 1-2 weeks)
Aim for 500+ karma before promoting anything

FINDING YOUR SUBREDDITS:

Search for: r/Notion, r/productivity, r/template, r/Entrepreneur
For Canva: r/graphic_design, r/smallbusiness, r/Instagram
Join 10-15 relevant subreddits
Read rules carefully (most ban self-promotion)

CONTENT STRATEGY (Value-first approach):
Phase 1: Establish Credibility (Weeks 1-3)

Answer questions genuinely
Share free tips and resources
No product mentions
Build comment karma

Phase 2: Subtle Introduction (Week 4+)

When someone asks: "Anyone know a good Notion template for X?"
You: "I actually built one for this exact use case. Happy to share if you want to DM me"
Or comment with Imgur link showing your template (not direct product link)

Phase 3: Value Posts with Soft CTA

Create genuinely helpful posts:

"I analyzed 50 Notion templates and here's what works"
"Here's my entire content planning system (template included)"


Include screenshots/walkthrough
At the end: "Edit: Several people asked, so here's the link to the template I use: [link]"

SUBREDDIT-SPECIFIC TACTICS:
r/Notion approach:

Share template screenshots
Offer to share via DM
Create "Show & Tell" posts when allowed
Participate in weekly template threads

r/Entrepreneur approach:

Share your journey building/selling templates
Ask for feedback on your product (genuine)
Offer free versions for feedback

General subreddit approach:

Search for questions you can answer with your product
Example: Someone posts "How do you organize client info?"
You: Explain your system + "I have a template that does this if you want it"

RULES TO NEVER BREAK:

Don't spam links across multiple subreddits
Don't post same content repeatedly
Always add value beyond just linking
Respect "no self-promotion" rules
When in doubt, offer to DM instead of public link


8. Email Marketing (YOUR OWNED TRAFFIC)
Why it works: You own the list. Highest ROI. Converts 10-20x better than social media.
Step-by-Step Email Blueprint:
EMAIL CAPTURE SETUP:

Choose platform: ConvertKit (best for creators), MailerLite (free tier), Flodesk (beautiful templates)
Create lead magnet:

Free starter template
"3 Canva templates on me"
"Notion setup guide PDF"


Create landing page for lead magnet (use platform's landing page builder)
Link this in ALL social bios

WELCOME SEQUENCE (Automated, 7 emails):
Email 1 (Immediate): Deliver free template + set expectations
Email 2 (Day 2): Tutorial on using the free template
Email 3 (Day 4): Case study/testimonial from customer
Email 4 (Day 6): Introduce paid product (soft sell)
Email 5 (Day 8): Objection handling + FAQ
Email 6 (Day 10): Limited-time discount offer
Email 7 (Day 14): Last chance + testimonials
REGULAR BROADCAST EMAILS (1-2x/week):

Tuesday: Value email (tutorial, tip, resource)
Friday: Product mention or new release

EMAIL COPYWRITING FORMULA:
Subject lines that work:

"Quick question about [topic]..."
"This saved me 10 hours this week"
"[Name], I made something for you"
"The template that changed everything"

Body structure:

Personal greeting
Tell a story or share insight
Deliver value
Soft CTA to product
Sign with your name


CROSS-PLATFORM STRATEGY (The Real Secret)
Don't just pick one platform - create a content ecosystem:
Content Repurposing Flow:

Create YouTube tutorial (your pillar content)
Chop into 3-5 TikTok/Instagram Reels
Extract quotes for Twitter threads
Screenshots for Pinterest pins
LinkedIn carousel from tutorial steps
Reddit post summarizing key points
Email to list with link to video

Weekly Content Schedule Example:

Monday: Film 1 YouTube video
Tuesday: Edit + upload YouTube, create 5 TikToks from it
Wednesday: Post TikToks, create Pinterest pins
Thursday: Write Twitter thread from video content
Friday: Create LinkedIn carousel
Weekend: Engage on all platforms, plan next week

This way, one hour of filming becomes 20+ pieces of content across all platforms.
The 90-Day Launch Plan:
Days 1-30: Build foundation

Set up all profiles
Post daily on 2-3 platforms
Focus on value, no selling
Grow to 500-1000 followers

Days 31-60: Introduce products
