Tasks
T001: Landing page CTAs go to signup, not login
Blocked By: []
Details:
"Start Selling Free", "Get Started", "Create Your Store", and pricing CTAs all navigate to /auth which defaults to login mode
New users clicking these should land on the signup form, not login
Add ?mode=signup to CTA links, update auth page to read the URL param and default to signup when present
Keep "Sign In" button going to /auth (login mode)
Files: client/src/pages/landing.tsx, client/src/pages/auth.tsx
Acceptance: Clicking "Start Selling Free" or "Get Started" opens the signup form; "Sign In" opens the login form
T002: Clean up error messages — no raw JSON in toasts
Blocked By: []
Details:
throwIfResNotOk in client/src/lib/queryClient.ts throws new Error(\${res.status}: ${text}`)which includes raw JSON like401: {"message":"Invalid email or password"}`
Parse the JSON response and extract the message field for clean error text
This affects ALL error toasts across the entire app (login, register, mutations, etc.)
Files: client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
Acceptance: Error toasts show clean messages like "Invalid email or password" instead of raw JSON
T003: Widen store creation dialog to show all 6 templates
Blocked By: []
Details:
The CreateStoreDialog in sidebar.tsx uses <DialogContent> with default width — too narrow for 6 templates
Add className="max-w-3xl" to the DialogContent so the template grid renders properly
Files: client/src/components/dashboard/sidebar.tsx
Acceptance: "Create New Store" dialog shows all 6 templates in a readable grid (3 per row minimum)
T004: Sync admin password on every startup
Blocked By: []
Details:
seedAdminUser() in server/seed.ts never updates the password hash if the admin already exists
When admin exists, re-hash ADMIN_PASSWORD and update the password in DB so it always matches the env var
Files: server/seed.ts
Acceptance: Admin login always works with current env var values, even after DB restores
T005: Full end-to-end test as a regular user (not admin)
Blocked By: [T001, T002, T003, T004]
Details:
Start at landing page, click "Get Started" → should open signup form
Register a new user with random email
Verify dashboard overview shows inline store creation form (not "Ready for liftoff?")
Create a store selecting one of the 6 templates
Verify getting-started checklist appears
Navigate through every sidebar page: Products, My Products, Library, Content Creator, Bundles, Marketing, Coupons, Orders, Settings
Verify all pages have consistent full-width layout (no max-w constraints)
Try an invalid login to verify clean error message (no raw JSON)
Test on mobile viewport (400px) for responsiveness
Files: all pages
Acceptance: Complete new-user journey works perfectly with clean UI, proper errors, and consistent layout
